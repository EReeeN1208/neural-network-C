# C Neural Network

Attempt to implement a neural network from scratch in C to enhance my C and NN knowledge.

Dataset: [Mnist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv)

The data CSV Files were too large for GitHub. Extract the `mnist.zip` archive in `/data` into `/data`.

## To Do

- [x] Implement Back-propagation (Network Training)
- [ ] Implement Network & Parameter serialization & deserialization (saving/loading)
- [ ] Optimize Network Training/Execution (Perhaps cuda?)
- [x] Platform differentiation for file loading (Windows/Unix)
- [ ] Better interface/ui/visualisation
- [ ] Finish Readme (running, documentation, hindsight...)
